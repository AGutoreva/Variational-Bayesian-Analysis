{"name":"Vba-toolbox","tagline":"The VBA toolbox","body":"# What is this?\r\n\r\nMost models of neurobiological and behavioural data can be broken down into processes that evolve over time and static observation mappings. Given these evolution and observation mappings, the toolbox can be used to simulate data, perform statistical data analysis, optimize the experimental design, etc... In brief, the toolbox provides:\r\n\r\n* a library of computational models of behavioural and neurobiological data time series\r\n* quick and efficient probabilistic inference techniques for parameter estimation and model comparison (+ experimental design optimization)\r\n* graphical visualization of results (+ advanced diagnostics of model inversion) \r\n\r\nThe toolbox can be downloaded directly from the [here](https://github.com/MBB-team/VBA-toolbox/zipball/master).\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative project, in that users can contribute to the toolbox either through feedback, or directly by including new models for neurobiological and behavioural data. Critically, the toolbox has been developped in the aim of facilitating the inclusion of new models (without having to care about their statistical treatment).\r\n\r\nWant to get started?
