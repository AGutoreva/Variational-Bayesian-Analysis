As we have described [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/_wiki/Structure-of-VBA's-generative-model.md), VBA handles a specific class of generative models, namely: non-linear state-space models. As we discuss below, this class of models is in fact very general, and can be used to emulate more sophisticated generative models that would apparently necessitate an extension of VBA's inference capabilities.
