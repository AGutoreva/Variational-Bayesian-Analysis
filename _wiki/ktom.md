title: "Bayesian mentalizing (k-ToM)"

{:toc}

When it comes to interpreting others' behaviour, we almost irrepressibly engage in the attribution of mental states (beliefs, emotionsâ€¦). Such "mentalizing" can become very sophisticated, eventually endowing us with highly adaptive skills such as convincing, teaching or deceiving. Here, sophistication can be captured in terms of the depth of our recursive beliefs, as in "I think that you think that I think...". In Devaine et al. (2014), we show such sophisticated recursive beliefs subtend learning in the context of social interaction.
